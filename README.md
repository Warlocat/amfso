# amfso
SOC integrals generator with atomic-mean-field (AMF) approximation.

It supports:
    RHF, UHF, Spin-free X2C, Dirac-Hartree-Fock (DHF) for single atom;
    Generate spin-orbit coupling integrals based on AMF approximation with MO from above methods.

To use, you must have:
    Eigen3 C++
    GSL library
